## Chapter 4: 

Sam thought to respond on the last raised query by Squeak asking for the reverse Fibonacci Series. She explained her the complete way on how to create a Fibonacci Series on own and then gave first few elements of the Series in reverse. She sent the POST request back to Squeak like below:

```
{
  "goblins": [
    {
      "name": "Squeak",
      "answer": "Quite interesting question you asked. Create a Fibonacci Series by starting it from 1 and keep adding
                last 2 numbers of the Series and keep storing in a array.Continue doing so till you reach the desired
                point and then reverse the array. Below is the example:"
      "answer": "144, 89, 34, 21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1"
    }
  ]
}
```
...Nothing came for about 2 minutes. Sam was feeling very hungry. So she decided to go back home and eat her dinner. But as she turned her back, a sound came...Hey hey! where are you going? Please see the response first. 
She was astonished to hear the audio. But then she controlled her anxiety and turned back to see the received response...

```
{
  "goblins": [
    {
      "name": "Squeak",
      "response": "Wonderful Information. You are indeed great.  Let's see if you can solve my another query."
    }
  ]
}
```

Sam still couln't understand if it will be the end or still more is waiting at the endpoint. Sam literally wanted to go back home as she was hungry and Christmas was also approaching for which she had to do the preparations. Big Question...Shall Sam go back or give a last try to know what was waiting there in the codebase for her.

### What does Sam decide to do next?
- If Sam decides to dig deeper into the codebase for further research, turn to [Chapter 7](Chapter7.md).
- If Sam decides to go back home and work on Christmas preparations, turn to [Chapter 8](Chapter8.md).
